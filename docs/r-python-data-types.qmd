# Data Structures

***Homogeneous***

-   **Atomic Vectors**

***Heterogenous***

-   **Lists**: Different data types for storage are possible. Most commonly seen as output since can be easier accessed. More flexible than vectors, but can be difficult to work with.

-   **Matrices**: Two dimensional arrangement of values (m x n).

-   **Data frames**: Stores data efficiently in an organized manner. Essentially a list of equal length vectors (like a matrix but structured better).

## Accessing and subsetting elements

**Indexing: Accessing elements from different data structures**

-   R vs Python: Indexing is different! R uses ***1-index*** while Python uses ***0-index***.
